      "answer": "Cryptographic Failures refer to situations where sensitive data is not adequately protected due to the absence, misuse, or weak implementation of cryptographic mechanisms. These failures often stem from using outdated encryption algorithms, poor key management, or simply transmitting or storing data without encryption. It is considered a serious vulnerability because it can lead to data breaches, loss of user trust, regulatory violations (such as GDPR or HIPAA), and potentially severe financial penalties. Sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, personal identifiers, and session tokens must be safeguarded using modern cryptographic practices to prevent unauthorized access or leakage.",

      "answer": "Proper cryptographic implementation ensures that data remains confidential and tamper-proof, whether it's being transmitted over the network (data in transit) or stored in databases or files (data at rest). Without encryption, attackers can intercept data using tools like packet sniffers or retrieve it from compromised storage systems. Even if encryption is used, incorrect implementation—such as using weak algorithms (like MD5 or SHA1), hard-coded keys, or failing to validate certificates—can render it ineffective. Therefore, applying strong, vetted encryption algorithms along with secure protocols (like TLS 1.2 or 1.3) is essential to protect sensitive information.",

For instance, storing passwords in plaintext or using weak hashing algorithms could lead to easy compromise if attackers gain access. A data breach caused by this poor practice is a consequence of the cryptographic failure.

Hashing, on the other hand, is a one-way function used to produce a fixed-length output from variable input, mainly for verifying data integrity or storing passwords securely.

Adaptive hashing functions like bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2 are intentionally slow and can be configured to become slower as hardware improves.

      "answer": "Tokenization replaces sensitive data with unique identifiers (tokens) that have no mathematical relationship to the original data. Unlike encryption, which transforms data using an algorithm and a key, tokenization stores the mapping between token and data in a secure vault. If tokens are compromised, the original data cannot be derived without access to the token vault. Tokenization is often used in payment systems and complies better with certain regulations like PCI-DSS due to its reduced attack surface.",
