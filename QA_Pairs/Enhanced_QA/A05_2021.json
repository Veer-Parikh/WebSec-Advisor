      "answer": "Security Misconfiguration refers to the improper setup or maintenance of security controls in software systems, applications, and infrastructure. This can include leaving default credentials unchanged, enabling unnecessary features, exposing sensitive error messages, or failing to apply security patches. Such misconfigurations create exploitable vulnerabilities that attackers can use to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or disrupt services. Because these issues often exist across the entire software stack and environments, they can lead to widespread compromise if not properly managed.",
