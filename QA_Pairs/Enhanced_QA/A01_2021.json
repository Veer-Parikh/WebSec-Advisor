      "answer": "Security through obscurity fails because attackers can discover hidden URLs through tools, guesswork, or traffic inspection. If those URLs lack proper authorization checks, they can be exploited. Real security comes from enforcing permissions regardless of whether the route is known or hidden.

      "question": "Why is it important to segregate duties and enforce role separation to proactively prevent Broken Access Control?",
      "answer": "Role separation ensures that no single user has excessive permissions that could be abused. Segregating duties limits the impact of compromised accounts or insider threats by restricting access to sensitive functions.",

      "question": "How does using strong cryptographic techniques to protect access tokens and session data help proactively prevent Broken Access Control?",
      "answer": "Strong encryption and secure storage prevent attackers from intercepting or tampering with tokens and sessions. This preserves their integrity and confidentiality, ensuring that only authorized users can gain access.",
